\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

\section{Others goal}
In the SCM league, profit-maximizing is the goal of RL-agent, in game theory we could get many goals, such as welfare-maximization, pareto optimality. How to achieve these goals with RL-methods based on the developed environments in NegMAS and SCML?

\section{Evaluation}
Many metrics in the filed multi agent could be used for evaluating the agents proposed in this paper, such as....

\section{Design of reward function}
Reward function is an important part of realizing of RL-Agent, In the future could develop a more effective reward function, such as method proposed in the paper by [].

\section{Complex environment}

\section{Huge scale high performance learning}
