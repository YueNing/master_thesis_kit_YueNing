Consider an agent that can cooperate with others and autonomously negotiate, to reach an agreement. These agents could achieve great results, such as presenting the profitability of factory. This type of agent is practical in complex and realistic environments(e.g. supply chain management). In the experiments of this thesis, it is proposed to use Multi-Agent deep reinforcement learning methods (e.g. \gls{qmix} and \gls{maddpg}) to implement learnable agents to achieve these goals. When interacting with others continuously, training intensively but performing actions based on local observations, the agent’s strategy will be improved. The learned strategy enables autonomous agents to negotiate in real time with multiple different types of unknown opponents on complex and multiple issues.
