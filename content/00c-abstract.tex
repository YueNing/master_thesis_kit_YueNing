Consider an agent that can cooperate with others and autonomously negotiate, to reach an agreement. These agents could achieve great score, e.g. profitability of factory in realistic. Such agent is practice in complex, realistic environment such as supply chain management. In experiments come from this paper, learnable agents are proposed with Multi-Agent deep reinforcement learning method(\gls{qmix} and \gls{maddpg}) to achieve the goal. The strategy of agent will be improved when continuously interacting with others, central training but executing with local observation. The learned strategy enable autonomous agents to negotiate concurrently with multiple different type, unknow opponents in real-time, over complex multi-issues.
