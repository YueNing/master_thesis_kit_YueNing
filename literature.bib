abstract = {This paper investigates the data-driven MultiVariate Dynamic Modelling (MVDM) and MultiStep-Ahead Prediction (MSAP) of nonlinear systems based on the Ordinary Kriging (OK) metamodel. The OK is used to build a set of Nonlinear Autoregressive models with Exogenous inputs (NAREX), able to approximate the system future outputs as a function of previous inputs and outputs considering a specific delay. Then, these OK-based dynamic models are used in a recursive interactive interpolations scheme to predict the process outputs over several time steps. The capabilities of the OK-based dynamic models are compared to other leading techniques, via their application to benchmark cases. The application results reveal the OK promising and competitive capabilities for MVDM of nonlinear systems, in terms of prediction accuracy and prediction time horizon.}

abstract = {Achieving the objective of identifying epileptic seizure activities automatically using electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is of great significance in the treatment of epilepsy. To realize this goal, a hybrid approach to analyze the time–frequency (t–f) image of EEG signals is employed in this study. In the proposed approach, the EEG signals are transformed into a t–f image using short-time Fourier transform and the t–f images are further decomposed into various component images by applying coiflet wavelet transformation. The texture descriptor, namely the local binary pattern, gray-level cooccurrence matrix, and local tetra pattern methods, are employed to compute the features from the wavelet-filtered images. The extracted features are fed into four different classifiers for t–f image classification. Experimental evaluation performed on two publicly available EEG datasets suggests that the proposed method is a proficient and powerful method for more accurate and earlier detection of epilepsy.}

abstract="The concept of a Nash equilibrium plays a central role in noncooperative game theory. Due in its current formalization to John Nash (1950, 1951), it goes back at least to Cournot (1838). This entry begins with the formal definition of a Nash equilibrium and with some of the mathematical properties of equilibria. Then we ask: To what question is `Nash equilibrium' the answer? The answer that we suggest motivates further questions of equilibrium selection, which we consider in two veins: the informal notions, such as Schelling's (1960) focal points; and the formal theories for refining or perfecting Nash equilibria, due largely to Selten (1965, 1975). We conclude with a brief discussion of two related issues: Harsanyi's (1967--8) notion of a game of incomplete information and Aumann's (1973) correlated equilibria.",

abstract="This paper presents a general framework for multilateral turn-taking protocols and two fully specified protocols namely Stacked Alternating Offers Protocol (SAOP) and Alternating Multiple Offers Protocol (AMOP). In SAOP, agents can make a bid, accept the most recent bid or walk way (i.e., end the negotiation without an agreement) when it is their turn. AMOP has two different phases: bidding and voting. The agents make their bid in the bidding phase and vote the underlying bids in the voting phase. Unlike SAOP, AMOP does not support walking away option. In both protocols, negotiation ends when the negotiating agents reach a joint agreement or some deadline criterion applies. The protocols have been evaluated empirically, showing that SAOP outperforms AMOP with the same type of conceder agents in a time-based deadline setting. SAOP was used in the ANAC 2015 competition for automated negotiating agents.",

  title={Multiagent Reinforcement Learning With Sparse Interactions by Negotiation and Knowledge Transfer},

  volume={47},

  pages={1238-1250},
  abstract={Reinforcement learning has significant applications for multiagent systems, especially in unknown dynamic environments. However, most multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms suffer from such problems as exponential computation complexity in the joint state-action space, which makes it difficult to scale up to realistic multiagent problems. In this paper, a novel algorithm named negotiation-based MARL with sparse interactions (NegoSIs) is presented. In contrast to traditional sparse-interaction-based MARL algorithms, NegoSI adopts the equilibrium concept and makes it possible for agents to select the nonstrict equilibrium-dominating strategy profile (nonstrict EDSP) or meta equilibrium for their joint actions. The presented NegoSI algorithm consists of four parts: 1) the equilibrium-based framework for sparse interactions; 2) the negotiation for the equilibrium set; 3) the minimum variance method for selecting one joint action; and 4) the knowledge transfer of local ${Q}$ -values. In this integrated algorithm, three techniques, i.e., unshared value functions, equilibrium solutions, and sparse interactions are adopted to achieve privacy protection, better coordination and lower computational complexity, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the presented NegoSI algorithm, two groups of experiments are carried out regarding three criteria: 1) steps of each episode; 2) rewards of each episode; and 3) average runtime. The first group of experiments is conducted using six grid world games and shows fast convergence and high scalability of the presented algorithm. Then in the second group of experiments NegoSI is applied to an intelligent warehouse problem and simulated results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented NegoSI algorithm compared with other state-of-the-art MARL algorithms.},

TITLE = {Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach for Residential Microgrid Energy Scheduling},
JOURNAL = {Energies},
VOLUME = {13},
YEAR = {2020},
NUMBER = {1},

ABSTRACT = {Residential microgrid is widely considered as a new paradigm of the home energy management system. The complexity of Microgrid Energy Scheduling (MES) is increasing with the integration of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and Renewable Generations (RGs). Moreover, it is challenging to determine optimal scheduling strategies to guarantee the efficiency of the microgrid market and to balance all market participants’ benefits. In this paper, a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach for residential MES is proposed to promote the autonomy and fairness of microgrid market operation. First, a multi-agent based residential microgrid model including Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and RGs is constructed and an auction-based microgrid market is built. Then, distinguish from Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning (SARL), MARL can achieve distributed autonomous learning for each agent and realize the equilibrium of all agents’ benefits, therefore, we formulate an equilibrium-based MARL framework according to each participant’ market orientation. Finally, to guarantee the fairness and privacy of the MARL process, we proposed an improved optimal Equilibrium Selection-MARL (ES-MARL) algorithm based on two mechanisms, private negotiation and maximum average reward. Simulation results demonstrate the overall performance and efficiency of proposed MARL are superior to that of SARL. Besides, it is verified that the improved ES-MARL can get higher average profit to balance all agents.},

abstract = {Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are relatively new computational tools that have found extensive utilization in solving many complex real-world problems. The attractiveness of ANNs comes from their remarkable information processing characteristics pertinent mainly to nonlinearity, high parallelism, fault and noise tolerance, and learning and generalization capabilities. This paper aims to familiarize the reader with ANN-based computing (neurocomputing) and to serve as a useful companion practical guide and toolkit for the ANNs modeler along the course of ANN project development. The history of the evolution of neurocomputing and its relation to the field of neurobiology is briefly discussed. ANNs are compared to both expert systems and statistical regression and their advantages and limitations are outlined. A bird’s eye review of the various types of ANNs and the related learning rules is presented, with special emphasis on backpropagation (BP) ANNs theory and design. A generalized methodology for developing successful ANNs projects from conceptualization, to design, to implementation, is described. The most common problems that BPANNs developers face during training are summarized in conjunction with possible causes and remedies. Finally, as a practical application, BPANNs were used to model the microbial growth curves of S. flexneri. The developed model was reasonably accurate in simulating both training and test time-dependent growth curves as affected by temperature and pH.}
